Tasks Manager
=====================

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Building

A basic production script is included that builds your app to a `dist` folder

```
npm run build
```

### Using `0.0.0.0` as Host

You may want to change the host in `webpack.config.js` from `localhost` to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from same WiFi network. This is not enabled by default because it is reported to cause problems on Windows. This may also be useful if you're using a VM.
